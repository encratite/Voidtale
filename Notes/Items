Aiming for 150 base defence on items at level 20, we end up with 60 for the armour and 30 for the other items.
Let's stick to about 5 items per category in the beginning, although not for the weapons.
The level requirements are 1, 5, 9, 13, 17.

About 50% of the DPS is supposed to come from weapon base stats.
Approximately 10 + 5 * (level - 1) damage.

Flasks have a capacity of 40 charges and use 10 charges on activation by default.
Each charge is supposed to heal about 30% of the maximum life/mana.
That means (50 + 25 * (level - 1)) * 0.3 life and (25 + 20 * (level - 1)) * 0.3 mana.
