Each character class comes with a small number of skills that are gradually unlocked as the character gains levels.
A new skill is unlocked at the following levels:
1, 2, 4, 6, 9, 12, 16, 20 (8 skills in total per class)
They are bound to the keys QWER and ASDF by default.
The power of skills scales automatically with levels.
The four final skills also require training to be learned and do not become available automatically as the required level is gained.

Characters do not possess anything like Diablo II style strength/dexterity/vitality/energy attributes.
There is no choice in specialisation as a character gains levels.
However, I might add something like a talent tree that modifies skills slightly later on.

The following item slots are available on each character:

Weapon     Helmet
Jewelry    Chest armour
Gloves     Boots
