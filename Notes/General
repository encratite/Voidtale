Each character class comes with a small number of skills that are gradually unlocked as the character gains levels.
A new skill is unlocked at the following levels:
1, 2, 4, 6, 9, 12, 16, 20 (8 skills in total per class)
They are bound to the keys QWER and ASDF by default.
The power of skills scales automatically with levels.
The four final skills also require training to be learned and do not become available automatically as the required level is gained.

Characters do not possess anything like Diablo II style strength/dexterity/vitality/energy attributes.
There is no choice in specialisation as a character gains levels.
However, I might add something like a talent tree that modifies skills slightly later on.

The following item slots are available on each character:

Weapon     Helm
Jewelry    Armour
Gloves     Boots

There is one general type of protection from damage called "defence" which works against all types of damage.
Additionally there are damage-specific types of "resistance".
The damage factor is calculated as follows:

protection = defence + resistance
damageFactor = 1 - protection / (protection + 100)

This is based on the formula used in League of Legends.
The general damage reduction and damage type specific reduction were influenced by Diablo III.
The damage types are similar to those of Diablo II:

1. Physical
2. Fire
3. Lightning
4. Cold
5. Poison

There is also a flat damage reduction stat called "block".
It's applied after the reduction by defence and resistance, so it's possible to reduce damage taken to zero.

Defensive stats are proportionally distributed like this:

Helm      20%
Armour    40%
Gloves    20%
Boots     20%

Weapons and jewelry do not possess base defensive stats.

The damage of skills generally scales with both the level of the character and damage stats obtained from items.
The effective level for a skill can be further modified by skill level bonuses granted by special class-specific items.

skillLevel = characterLevel + itemSkillLevelBonus
itemDamage = random(weaponMinimumDamage, weaponMaximumDamage) + itemDamageTypeBonus
skillDamage = skillBaseDamage + skillLevelFactor * skillLevel + skillDamageFactor * itemDamage

Weapons do not only possess a minimum damage and a maximum damage stat but also a base attack speed stat that affects the casting speed and cooldown time of offensive skills.

Very slow   0.8
Slow        0.9
Normal      1.0
Fast        1.1
Very fast   1.2

cooldownFactor = 1 / baseAttackSpeed

However, the mana cost does not scale with this so slower weapons are basically more mana effective in this model.
Perhaps this could be balanced for by granting faster weapons slightly more DPS.

The experience of a character is reset to zero after a level is gained.
When a character dies to NPCs, it loses up to 30% of the experience required to gain the next level, back down to a minimum of zero.

experienceForLevel = 50 * level * (level - 1)
