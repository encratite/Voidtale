Let's have a look at the current Steam Hardware Survey Stats to figure out what resolutions should be supported:

(Resolution, market share, inner browser aspect ratio)
1920 x 1080, 32%, 2.06
1366 x 768, 21%, 2.21
1280 x 1024, 8%, 1.46
1680 x 1050, 8%, 1.87
1600 x 900, 8%, 2.13

These five resolutions already cover like 77% of the market.

In my more extreme case the vertical resolution loss to the taskbar and such is 1080 px - 878 px = 202 px
Overall the minimum is 1280 px in width and 768 px in width, prior to waste.
One measurement of a real life 1366 x 768 example showed an inner browser height of 629 px, with a waste of only 139 px.
On my notebook it's even only 602 px, 166 px wasted.

That's approximately 1280 x 600 permissible.
Minus 40 for each dimension to get a bit of space at the edges, 1240 x 560.
Another 40 for the scrollbar on the right side and we're at 1200.

A game resolution of 1200 x 560 should work on a wide range of systems.

Or I could go for a 2 : 1 aspect ratio layout and simply use higher resolution textures that are scaled for everything.
Only the aspect ratios of the textures would matter then.
However, it would be difficult to get a seamless look then.
It might be possible with one big texture for most of the GUI.
The 2.0 aspect ratio is terrible for the 1280 x 1024 one, though.

1080p graphics are probably a bit too heavy for a browser game.
1600 x 800 might be a decent format to optimise the sources for.
That aspect ratio might seem odd but it's more suited for the aspect rati of what's usually visible in a brwoser.
